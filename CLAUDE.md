# Launchpad Application Portal

Admissions portal for Launchpad Philly (a Building 21 program). Students apply through a 7-step process; staff manage the pipeline through an admin dashboard.

## Read first

- `PRD.md` — the full product spec. Read it before building anything. The Notion version is canonical; this copy is synced June 10, 2026.
- `school-dropdown-options.json` — canonical school names (82 dropdown options + 31 Track A partner schools). Seed a `schools` table from this; match on school ID, never on name strings.
- `brand/launchpad-logo-main-color.svg` — logo for header and emails.

## Stack (decided, do not revisit)

- Next.js (App Router, TypeScript) on Vercel
- Supabase: Postgres, Auth, Storage (transcripts ~200/cycle)
- Resend for transactional email; Twilio for SMS
- Native canvas e-signature (signature_pad), no third-party e-sign provider

## Non-negotiable rules from the PRD

- Mobile-first; Building 21 brand (colors/typography in PRD Brand & Design section); font sizes in multiples of 3, body 15px, 1.3 line height
- Parents never create accounts; the parent form is reached by tokenized link only
- The public student status link shows step status only, never PII, essays, or demographics
- Admissions decisions are hidden from students until an admin manually triggers the decision email
- Students can edit steps after submitting; only staff progress Steps 4, 5, 6
- Audit-log all admin edits to student info, interview/status updates, and decisions
- Demographic data is for funder reporting only and must never affect application logic
- Strive for WCAG compliance on all public-facing pages

## Conventions

- Cycle-specific copy (dates, locations, program info) lives in the database as admin-editable settings, never hardcoded
- School lists (dropdown + partner flags) are admin-editable data, seeded from school-dropdown-options.json
- Decision statuses: Offer Extended, Waitlisted, Denied, Withdrew, Acceptance Rescinded, Offer Accepted, Offer Not Accepted, Ineligible
